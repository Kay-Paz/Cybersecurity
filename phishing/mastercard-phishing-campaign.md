> Explore a day in the life of a Security Analyst at Mastercard!  
 
- In partnership with [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) and [New York Jobs CEO Council ](https://nyjobsceocouncil.org/)  
    
- Task was to design a phishing email for a simulated security awareness campaign for internal employees  
 
In order to maximize potential engagement, I decided to reference employee pay for the email. I wanted to create an email that would be plausible to send company-wide, so that its generic/general tone wouldn't raise alarms.

With that in mind, I figured tax docs are the way to go. I also made sure to include some "call to action" language by specifying a deadline and encouraged urgency by mentioning possible financial penalties.

All the links lead to the same URL placeholder that was listed in the instructions. I figured I'd increase my attack vector by using multiple hyperlinks and masking them a few different ways.

I also made sure to update email addresses to reflect the correct @mastercard.com address and included a typical "confidentiality notice" attached to most corporate emails.
